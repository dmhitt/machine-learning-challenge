### Findings:
 
* KNN - 81%
* Random Forests - 89%
* Logistic Regression - 87%
 
The best model that predicts new exoplanets is Random Forests at 89% accuracy.
 
I believe the model is good. 
 
### Conclusion:
To achieve a better prediction, further data cleaning and parameters tunning is necessary.
